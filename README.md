# Job Summary Text Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing job summaries. It involves multiple stages of text preprocessing, feature extraction, similarity detection, and evaluation using cross-validation. The script aims to process text data, extract features, detect similarities, and evaluate the methods to determine the most effective ones for the given task.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this script is sourced from Kaggle. It contains job summaries which are processed to extract features and detect similarities.

### Dataset Details

- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dataset_name)
- **File**: `job_summary.csv`
- **Description**: Contains job summaries for analysis.

## Dependencies

To run the script, you need to install the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- spacy
- textblob
- gensim
- beautifulsoup4
- lxml
- html5lib

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk spacy textblob gensim beautifulsoup4 lxml html5lib
```

Additionally, download the Spacy language model:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Preprocessing Functions

The script includes several preprocessing functions to clean and prepare the text data:

- **Remove Noise**:
  - `remove_noise_regex`: Removes digits and punctuation using regular expressions.
  - `remove_noise_html`: Removes HTML tags and normalizes text.
  - `remove_numbers`: Removes digits from the text.
  - `remove_punctuation`: Removes punctuation.

- **Text Normalization**:
  - `to_lowercase`: Converts text to lowercase.
  - `to_lowercase_spacy`: Converts text to lowercase using SpaCy.

- **Stop Words Removal**:
  - `remove_stopwords_nltk`: Removes stop words using NLTK.
  - `remove_stopwords_spacy`: Removes stop words using SpaCy.

- **Lemmatization**:
  - `lemmatize_nltk`: Lemmatizes text using NLTK.
  - `lemmatize_spacy`: Lemmatizes text using SpaCy.
  - `lemmatize_textblob`: Lemmatizes text using TextBlob.

- **Stemming**:
  - `stem_porter`: Stems text using Porter Stemmer.
  - `stem_snowball`: Stems text using Snowball Stemmer.
  - `stem_lancaster`: Stems text using Lancaster Stemmer.

## Feature Extraction Functions

Feature extraction is performed using the following methods:

- **TF-IDF**:
  - `tf_idf_feature_extraction`: Extracts features using TF-IDF vectorizer.
  - `tf_idf_spacy`: Extracts features using TF-IDF vectorizer with SpaCy preprocessing.

- **Bag of Words**:
  - `bag_of_words_feature_extraction`: Extracts features using Count Vectorizer.

## Similarity Detection Functions

The script supports different similarity detection methods:

- **Cosine Similarity**:
  - `cosine_similarity`: Computes cosine similarity between feature vectors.

- **Jaccard Similarity**:
  - `jaccard_similarity`: Computes Jaccard similarity between sets of tokens.

- **Edit Distance**:
  - `edit_distance`: Computes the edit distance between two strings.

## Evaluation

The script evaluates preprocessing methods, feature extraction, and similarity detection using cross-validation. It selects the best methods based on F1 scores calculated from the similarity detection results.

## Running the Script

1. **Set Up Kaggle API**:
   Set your Kaggle username and API key as environment variables:

   ```bash
   export KAGGLE_USERNAME="your_kaggle_username"
   export KAGGLE_KEY="your_kaggle_api_key"
   ```

2. **Download and Extract Dataset**:
   The script downloads and extracts the dataset from Kaggle:

   ```python
   !kaggle datasets download -d kaggle_username/dataset_name
   ```

   Unzip the dataset:

   ```python
   with ZipFile('dataset_name.zip', 'r') as zip_ref:
       zip_ref.extractall('data')
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script to process the data, extract features, and detect similarities.

## Example of Word2Vec Embedding

The script demonstrates the use of Word2Vec for word embeddings:

- Tokenizes job summaries and trains a Word2Vec model.
- Prints the embedding vector for a sample word and calculates the similarity between two words.
